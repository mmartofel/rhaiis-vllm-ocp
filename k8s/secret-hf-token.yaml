# The HF token secret is managed imperatively by deploy.sh to prevent
# accidental git commits of credentials. deploy.sh runs:
#
#   oc create secret generic hf-token-secret \
#     --from-literal=token="${HF_TOKEN}" \
#     -n "${NAMESPACE}" --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
#
# HF_TOKEN is read from user-values.env (which must NOT be committed to git).
#
# The model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ is publicly accessible, but a
# token (read-only is sufficient) helps avoid anonymous rate limits.
# Create a free account at huggingface.co and generate a token there.
