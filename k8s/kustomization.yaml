# NOTE: The primary deploy method is ./deploy.sh (repo root), not `oc apply -k`.
# deploy.sh sources user-values.env, renders ${VAR} placeholders via envsubst,
# and creates the HF token secret imperatively (keeping credentials out of YAML).
#
# This kustomization.yaml is kept for reference. secret-hf-token.yaml has been
# removed from the resources list — it is documentation only (see that file).
